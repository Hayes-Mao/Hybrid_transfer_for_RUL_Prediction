# Hybrid_transfer
Comparison of various transfer learning models with the hybridization of an LSTM for battery RUL prediction.

This study seeks to quantify the advantage of using images alongside health indicators with the use of readily available transfer learning models. This article uses the Toyota/MIT battery dataset to create the image and health indicator dataset. 
If you'd like to try out the network with the data, you'd need to download the Toyota/MIT battery dataset from the source at: https://data.matr.io/1/projects/5c48dd2bc625d700019f3204 and run the Matlab scripts
