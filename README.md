This study seeks to quantify the advantage of using images alongside health indicators with the use of readily available transfer learning models. This article uses the Toyota/MIT battery dataset to create the image and health indicator dataset. 
If you'd like to try out the network with the data, you'd need to download the Toyota/MIT battery dataset from the source at: https://data.matr.io/1/projects/5c48dd2bc625d700019f3204 
and run the Matlab scripts
